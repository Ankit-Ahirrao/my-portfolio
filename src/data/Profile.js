  about: `
I am a Full Stack Developer with professional experience building scalable web
applications and backend systems. My work focuses on clean architecture,
performance optimization, and reliable system design.

I have worked extensively with Ruby on Rails for building RESTful APIs,
database-driven applications, and enterprise systems. Alongside backend
engineering, I am comfortable working with modern frontend technologies
and cloud infrastructure.

I am currently pursuing my M.Tech in Computer Science at IIT Jammu and have
qualified GATE multiple times, including GATE CS and GATE Data Science.
